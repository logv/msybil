## msybil

This repo contains the msybil scripts for interacting with remote sybil hosts.

msybil.py can query hosts, while msybil_ingest.py is for ingesting data into
remote hosts.

### status

msybil.py is relatively stable and has been used for over a year now, while
msybil_ingest.py is still under development. a current weakness for
msybil_ingest.py is in the failure path - that will be resolved eventually.
